#GMapHere

A simple extension that removes a useful clutter from your life. Ever tried
getting direction to a location that you found over facebook? I bet you did.
Well that **Here** map is not that much of your type,right? You expected a route with proper place names and all the places nearby that location to be enlisted- rather you found a graveyard of scattered pushpins!

I know you love Google Maps- and so **GMapHere** browser extension is to rescue you! Simply install and then click on same **Get Directions** button of any location in facebook- voila! You are looking at the location in your favorite Google Maps. 

Try now. 

Give me something to care about- give me feedback.
